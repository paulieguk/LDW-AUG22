### Task 3

---

In this task you will launch the Lab Profile and have a test.  Some tasks to explore:

- Notice the look and feel is similar to using a VM in one of the Skillable Datacenters
- Launch browsers to confirm Internet access
- Notice the Notepad++ Application on the desktop, this could be any additional application (this is because we captured the image)

![!ALERT] You might notice our lab client opens before the VM is ready so you might need to Reconnect.  This can be offset using a delay time on the Advance page of the Lab Profile.

- Launch the Lab Profile have a review then end the Lab Profile when you have finsihed exploring.

>[!KNOWLEDGE] Hopefully you did not find anything amazing as it is just like running any VM based lab in skillable.

> - Edit the instructions for the Lab Profile @lab.Variable(initials): LP-AWS-VM
> - Go to the Activities page (lightning bolt)
> - Click **+ New Automated Activity**
> - Notice in the Script 1 Target it lists the VM Name.  Cloud based VM's also support Skillabes Automated Activity capabilities.
> - Cancel and close out the diaglogs and close the instructions editor.
