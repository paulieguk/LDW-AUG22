### Task 3

---

In this task you will launch the Lab Profile and have a test.  Some tasks to explore:

- Notice the look and feel is similar to using a VM in one of the Skillable Datacentres
- Launch browsers to confirm Internet access
- In a command prompt type **ipconfig** to confirm the VM has an appropiate IP Address
- Notice the Notepad++ Application on the desktop, this could be any additional application (this is because we captured the image)

- Launch the Lab Profile have a review then end the Lab Profile when you have finsihed exploring.

>[!KNOWLEDGE] Hopefully you did not find anything amazing as it is just like running any VM based lab in skillable.
