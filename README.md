# Lab Developer Workshop - August 2022

This workshop is designed to show how to build labs that just use virtual machines as a Virtualisation fabric, rather than using the Skillable inhouse virtualisation platforms.

The course use cases for this would include:

 - Virtual Machines require Hardware GPU
  - Virtual Machines require massive resource requirements e.g., 1TB+ RAM
